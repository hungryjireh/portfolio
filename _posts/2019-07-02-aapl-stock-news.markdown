Over the summer, during my internship, I was tasked to redesign a website for the company that I was working with. The company site is built on Wordpress, and they were exploring the possibility of redesigning the website using [Elementor][elementor] plugin. 

Elementor is predominantly a drag-and-drop site builder, with a focus on design rather than on actual coding. As such, this task was a good opportunity for me to develop my skills in website design, as well as to create a good user experience (UX) for viewers of the website.

Since the main purpose of the website is to direct customers to purchase the packages that they offer, I had to ensure that users were sufficiently interested in what they were looking at to continue browsing the site, as well as to ultimately be directed to the "Pricing" page.

The main pages of the website can be found below.
