Togeher with a friend, who developed the frontend of the chat bot while I developed the backend using Python Django, we developed a Telegram Messenger bot that would alert subscribers whenever a new sermon was uploaded on the church's website.

Other functions of the bot include being able to get the past 5 sermons. Additionally, this bot also supports other church services, including Mandarin sermons and Dialect sermons as well.

A live version of this bot can be found on Telegram Messenger at [@RiverLifeBot][@RiverLifeBot].
