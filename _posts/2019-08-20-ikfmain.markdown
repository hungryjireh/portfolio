After redesigning the [Apple Stock News website][apple-blogpost], I was then tasked to redesigned the main website of the company. The current live main website can be found [here][main-website].

There were a couple of distinctive features which I was particularly pleased with. Firstly, as seen from the [Publications page][ikfmain-publications], there is a second grey navigation bar below the main navigation bar. As the company produces a lot of content, it is imperative for users to be aware of how to instinctively navigate through the different content sections of the website without being overwhelmed (which would lead to a higher bounce rate). By organising the website's content into another menu, this ensured that users would be able to get a quick glimpse of the available content, and visit the sections that may interest them from there.

Secondly, there is also a Facebook Messenger icon located at the bottom of the page. A sample can be seen from the "Home" page of the redesigned website. This essentially connects to a bot that I had built using Google's [Dialogflow][dialogflow], which is intended to help users get answers to frequently asked questions, if they should prefer a chatbot interface. By integrating the bot together with the site, this provides an alternative user experience, which is crucial since there are a range of different users that visit the company's main website.

The different pages which I had designed using [Elementor][elementor] can be found below. The website is currently still undergoing review, and it can be found [here][dev-area].
