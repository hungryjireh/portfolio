Hi there! I'm Jireh. I recently graduated from the Singapore University of Technology and Design with a Masters degree in Technology Entrepreneurship and a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Design (Honours with Distinction). I am currently a Software Engineer with <strong>JP Morgan</strong>.

<br><br>

I am generally proficient in <strong>Java (Spring and Spring Boot), as well as in JavaScript (React, Node.js) and Python (scripting, data analysis)</strong>. On a day-to-day basis, I am a Java engineer. For the most part of the past few years, however, I was mainly a JavaScript engineer. One example is an <a href="https://capstone2021.sutd.edu.sg/projects/identitypal-rethinking-hotel-check-in" target=”_blank”>offline Know-Your-Customer (KYC) project</a> that my team and I worked on with PayPal with as our final year project, where I worked on developing a mobile application using React Native Expo. Another example is <a href="https://www.trustb.io/" target=”_blank”>TrustB</a> (also <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-owned-businesses-pioneer-black-134800799.html" target=”_blank”>featured on Yahoo! News</a>) which I had independently developed the frontend for using React/Next.js during my internship with <a href="https://www.blockchainintel.com/" target=”_blank”>BlockchainIntel</a>, a blockchain analytics start-up based in San Francisco. My <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NpNd2VyywuvkQQpoXvoPKnEkttyfaoww/view?usp=sharing" target=”_blank”>graduate thesis</a> is entitled <strong>"Analyzing Misinformation in Cryptocurrency Markets"</strong>, where I used machine learning and deep learning models to identify potential sources of misinformation in terms of propaganda, financial speculation value, sentiment analysis and topic modeling within CoinTelegraph articles.

<br><br>

In the past, I've dabbled with web development more extensively, such as using Jekyll (you're seeing an example now!) and Django/Django Template/Django REST Framework. In recent times, I am more of a strong proponent of drag-and-drop website builders like <a href="https://squarespace.com" target=”_blank”>Squarespace</a> and would fervently recommend it to all non-tech (and tech!) friends looking to start their own businesses to avoid reliability issues and if all goes well, perhaps even scaling issues.

<br><br>

I'm currently based in Singapore. In my free time, I enjoy taking a walk around cities, or having conversations and hanging out with loved ones. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jireh-tan/" target="_blank">here</a>.
