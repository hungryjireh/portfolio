Hi there! I'm Jireh and I'm going into my third year at the Singapore University of Technology and Design with a major in Information Systems Technology and Design - which is otherwise known as Computer Science. 

<br><br>

I'm generally proficient in Python, and to a lesser extent, Java. You can check out some of the projects I've been / I was up to <a href="https://hungryjireh.github.io/portfolio/portfolio/">here</a>. I've had some experience with web development as well, most notably in building static websites in Bootstrap (see ALESCE's website <a href="https://www.alesce.co">here</a>), Jekyll (you're seeing an example now!) and Django/Django Template/Django REST Framework.

<br><br>

I'm currently based in Singapore! In my free time, I enjoy taking a walk around cities, or having conversations and hanging out with loved ones.
